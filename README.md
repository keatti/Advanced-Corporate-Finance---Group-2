# Advanced Corporate Finance Group Project / Group-2
Dear Professor, please find attached python scripts for Monte Carlo Simulation  & Cost of Equity using CAPM and FFM, that we used for the Group project.
For Monte Carlo script, we attached both in .py and .ipynb formats (in case one of the format doesn't work).
We also added the Excel named "Xiaomi PYTHON" on which we ran the Monte Carlo script, the two sheets involved are named "Python simulation" (that corresponds assumptions) and "Python output" were all the graphs and key statistics are shown.

Thank you for your time,
sincerely
Keattikhoun SUTHAS; Laure HAMMANN; Adam THIEBAUT.
